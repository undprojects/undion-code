# undion-code
Coding language based in Python

To get started, you need Python, after that we open start-win.bat, then we will create the file "name.udn" in which we enter the first two lines 
\undion on
clear
and then write pick{y:x} (pixels that we will paint over) and drag name.udn directly into this interface
